# 🧠 AI-Driven Loan Eligibility Predictor

An end-to-end **Machine Learning + Streamlit web application** that predicts a customer’s **loan eligibility** based on financial, demographic, and employment details.  
This project demonstrates the use of **data analytics, AI/ML models, and business decision insights** — aligning with real-world use cases in the **Banking and Financial Services (BFSI)** domain.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand data distribution, correlations, and key drivers of loan eligibility.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model:** Classification model trained using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms.
- 📊 **Interactive Streamlit Web App:** User-friendly web interface for input and prediction.
- ☁️ **Deployment-Ready:** Can be deployed easily on Streamlit Cloud or any cloud platform (AWS/GCP/Azure).
- 📈 **Data-Driven Insights:** Highlights customer characteristics most likely to impact loan approval.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mansianwala/Bank-Loan-Prediction-System-using-Streamlit.git
   cd Bank-Loan-Prediction-System-using-Streamlit
2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the Streamlit application**
    ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
4. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    http://localhost:8501

## 🧩 How It Works
-The user enters personal and financial details (income, dependents, credit history, etc.).
-The app preprocesses the data and feeds it into the trained ML model.
-The model outputs “Loan Approved” or “Loan Not Approved” based on input features.
-Results are displayed in a visually interactive interface.
